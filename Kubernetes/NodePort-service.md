ðŸ§  Why you're able to access the Pod from both nodes:
Even though the Pod is running on just one node, a NodePort service opens the same port (e.g., 30001) on every node in the cluster â€” not just the one where the Pod is running.

Kubernetes does this so that the service is reachable from any node's IP, regardless of where the actual Pod is scheduled.

ðŸ”„ How it works under the hood:
When you create a NodePort service:

Kubernetes configures each node to listen on the specified port (nodePort).

Traffic received on that port is routed to the correct Pod, even if the Pod is on a different node.

Kubernetes uses kube-proxy (which runs on all nodes) to handle this routing, usually via iptables or IPVS rules.

ðŸ”§ Example Scenario:
You have:

Node A (IP: 192.168.1.10)

Node B (IP: 192.168.1.11)

Pod is running only on Node A

Service with nodePort: 30001

Now:

http://192.168.1.10:30001 â†’ hits Node A directly â†’ traffic goes to the Pod.

http://192.168.1.11:30001 â†’ hits Node B â†’ kube-proxy forwards traffic to the Pod on Node A.

âœ… This behavior is normal and by design:
It's for high availability â€” so clients don't need to know where the Pod is running.

This way, you can balance or fail over across nodes as Pods move or restart.

Bonus Tip:
If you want traffic to only go to the node where the Pod is running, you'd have to:

Use hostPort (ties it to a specific node â€” not recommended for general use).

Use DaemonSets with hostNetwork (each node runs the service directly).

Use externalTrafficPolicy: Local in a LoadBalancer service to preserve the client source IP and route only to local pods (advanced use case).
