üì¶ What is Storage in Kubernetes?
In Kubernetes, storage refers to how your applications save and access data ‚Äî either inside the cluster or outside (like in cloud services or physical disks).

By default:

Data stored inside a Pod is temporary (ephemeral).

When a Pod dies, its internal data is gone unless you connect it to some external storage.

So:
‚û°Ô∏è Storage = External place where data is saved safely.
‚û°Ô∏è Kubernetes Storage = Mechanism to attach safe storage to Pods.

üìÇ Types of Storage in Kubernetes

Type	Description	Example
EmptyDir	Temporary storage shared between containers in a Pod.	Cache data, temp files.
HostPath	Uses a file or directory from the node's filesystem.	Logs stored on a node disk.
Persistent Volume (PV)	Cluster-wide storage resource.	AWS EBS, NFS, Ceph, etc.
Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)	Request for storage by a Pod.	User asks for 5GB storage.
ConfigMap & Secret	Special storage for configuration files and sensitive info.	DB URL, API keys.
StatefulSets Storage	Storage for apps that need stable, persistent storage per Pod.	Databases like MySQL, MongoDB.
üöÄ Main Concepts: PV and PVC

Concept	Explanation
PV (Persistent Volume)	Admin creates a storage resource in the cluster.
PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)	User claims (requests) a portion of that storage.
StorageClass	Defines how storage is dynamically created (optional).
‚ö° Example 1: Using EmptyDir (Simple Temporary Storage)
yaml
Copy
Edit
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: mycontainer
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
          name: myvolume
  volumes:
    - name: myvolume
      emptyDir: {}
‚úÖ Here, /usr/share/nginx/html inside the container can read/write files ‚Äî but they disappear when the Pod dies.
