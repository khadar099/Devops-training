Step 1: Set Up EC2 Instances
Using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI, launch three EC2 instances: one for the master node and two for the worker nodes. Ensure that the AWS EC2 instances meet the minimum requirements for running Kubernetes, including sufficient CPU, memory, and network connectivity.

Some general guidelines for minimum requirements of an Amazon EC2 instance to run a Kubernetes cluster : 

Master Node: (t2.medium recommended)

CPU: 2 vCPUs or more
RAM: 4 GB or more
Disk: 20 GB or more (for system and application binaries)
Network: Sufficient bandwidth for communication between nodes and with external services

Worker Nodes:

CPU: 1 vCPU or more (depending on workload)
RAM: 2 GB or more
Disk: 20 GB or more (for system and application binaries)
Network: Sufficient bandwidth for communication between nodes and with external services


Step 2: Install Docker
SSH into each Amazon EC2 instance and install Docker

You can use the following commands to install Docker :

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

sudo apt install docker.io -y

docker â€“version

systemctl start docker

systemctl enable docker
