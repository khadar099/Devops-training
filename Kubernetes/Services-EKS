#NodePort Service

What is it?

A NodePort service exposes your app on a static port on each worker node's IP.

The port is in the range 30000‚Äì32767.

You can then access your application using:

http://<NodeIP>:<NodePort>

‚úÖ Pros:
Simple to set up and doesn‚Äôt require any cloud provider-specific integration.

Good for development, testing, or internal use.

Can be used in combination with an external load balancer or ingress controller.

‚ùå Cons:
Not very user-friendly for external access (you need node IPs and ports).

Doesn‚Äôt handle load balancing by itself very well across nodes.

No built-in DNS name or SSL termination.

üì¶ Example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30080
You access this using:


http://<any-worker-node-ip>:30080

üîπ 2. LoadBalancer Service

üìå What is it?
A LoadBalancer service provisions a cloud load balancer (in this case, from AWS) to route external traffic to your application.

You get a public IP and DNS name automatically.

The traffic is distributed to the appropriate backend pods.

‚úÖ Pros:
Ideal for production use.

Provides a single entry point with automatic load balancing.

Easily integrates with AWS ELB/ALB, SSL, and DNS (Route 53).

Easier and more secure to expose services to the internet.

‚ùå Cons:
More expensive ‚Äì AWS charges for each provisioned Load Balancer.

Can take time to provision.

One LoadBalancer per service can lead to high costs.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
AWS will automatically create an ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) and provide an endpoint like:

üîÑ NodePort vs LoadBalancer: Comparison Table

Feature	NodePort	LoadBalancer
Exposure	Node IP + Port	Public IP + DNS (AWS ELB)
Cost	Free (uses existing nodes)	$$$ (AWS ELB cost)
Scalability	Limited	High
Ideal Use Case	Development, internal access	Production, external traffic
Ease of Access	Requires Node IPs	Easy via DNS/URL
Built-in Load Balancing	Minimal	Yes (via AWS ELB)
TLS/HTTPS Termination	Manual	Easy (via AWS integrations)

üîö Conclusion: Which One Is Best?
‚úÖ Use NodePort if:
You're in a dev/test environment.

You just need internal access or are using a separate external load balancer.

Cost is a concern.

‚úÖ Use LoadBalancer if:
You're in production and need to expose services securely and easily.

You want out-of-the-box scaling and AWS-native integration.

You need a public endpoint with DNS and SSL.

If you‚Äôre trying to optimize cost but still need load balancing, consider:

Ingress Controllers (like NGINX or AWS ALB Ingress) + NodePort/ClusterIP.

They allow you to expose multiple services via one load balancer.
