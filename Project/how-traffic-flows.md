🌐 User Traffic Flow: Route53 → CloudFront → ALB → Istio → Kubernetes (EKS)
Let’s assume the public domain is:

arduino

https://bankapp.example.com
✅ 1. User hits the browser with a URL
text
Copy
Edit
User → https://bankapp.example.com
✅ 2. Route 53 (DNS Resolution)
AWS Route 53 resolves the domain (bankapp.example.com) to a CloudFront distribution.

Alias record or CNAME → CloudFront URL

✅ 3. CloudFront (CDN & TLS termination)
CloudFront serves:

Cached Angular static files (index.html, JS, CSS)

For dynamic API calls (/api/**), CloudFront forwards them to Application Load Balancer (ALB).

SSL termination may happen at CloudFront or forwarded using HTTPS (depends on setup).

You can use WAF with CloudFront for protection.

✅ 4. WAF (Optional but recommended)
AWS Web Application Firewall attached to CloudFront or ALB.

Blocks malicious traffic (SQLi, XSS, bots).

✅ 5. ALB (Application Load Balancer)
Forwards HTTP(S) requests to the EKS Ingress Gateway.

ALB is configured to send traffic to NodePort or Target Group mapped to Istio Ingress Gateway (Envoy).

ALB supports path-based routing:

/ → Angular

/api/ → Java Backend

✅ 6. Istio Ingress Gateway (Envoy Proxy)
Sits inside the EKS cluster.

Routes traffic based on Istio VirtualService and Gateway configs.

Example:

/api/** → routed to Java microservice

/ → routed to Angular static pod (if served from container)

✅ 7. Istio VirtualService → Kubernetes Services
Istio applies routing rules like:

Load balancing

Version-based routing (canary/blue-green)

Fault injection, retries, timeouts

✅ 8. Kubernetes Services → Pods
Traffic is routed to the correct Kubernetes Service

Then sent to the correct backend pod (Java Spring Boot) or frontend pod (Angular) depending on path

✅ 9. Backend interacts with Database (SQL)
Java backend pod interacts with a RDS or self-hosted SQL DB in a private subnet

Secure connection using VPC, Secrets Manager/Vault

🔐 Security Considerations
Layer	Security Mechanism
Route 53	DNSSEC (if needed)
CloudFront	WAF + TLS + Signed URLs (if needed)
ALB	HTTPS only, AWS Shield
Istio	mTLS between services
Vault/Secrets	Manage DB/API keys securely
