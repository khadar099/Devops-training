‚úÖ Key Components of a Computer and How They Fail
1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
What it does: The brain of the computer ‚Äì it processes instructions and performs calculations.

Failure Symptoms:

System won't boot.

Random shutdowns or restarts.

Overheating.

Example:

A user‚Äôs PC suddenly shuts down during high processing tasks (e.g., video rendering). This could be due to CPU overheating or internal damage.

2. RAM (Memory) ‚Äì Random Access Memory
What it does: Temporarily stores data for currently running programs. Fast and volatile.

Failure Symptoms:

Frequent application crashes.

Blue screen errors (BSOD in Windows).

System restarts during workload.

Example:

A user is browsing with multiple tabs and the system crashes. This could indicate faulty or insufficient RAM.

3. Hard Disk Drive (HDD) / Solid State Drive (SSD) ‚Äì Storage
What it does: Stores the operating system, software, and files permanently.

Failure Symptoms:

Slow boot or file access.

Files disappearing or becoming corrupted.

"Operating system not found" error.

Example:

An employee‚Äôs laptop takes 15 minutes to start. The HDD may be failing. Replacing it with an SSD can solve the issue.

4. Motherboard (Mainboard)
What it does: Connects all parts of the computer ‚Äì CPU, RAM, storage, power, etc.

Failure Symptoms:

Computer not turning on.

No display output.

Burning smell or visible damage.

Example:

A computer that used to work fine no longer turns on, even with a new power supply. The motherboard might be dead.

5. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
What it does: Converts power from the wall to usable power for the computer.

Failure Symptoms:

No power to computer.

Random reboots.

Sparks or burning smell.

Example:

After a power outage, the desktop doesn‚Äôt turn on. The PSU may have been fried.

6. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
What it does: Renders images and videos. Important for gaming, video editing, or AI processing.

Failure Symptoms:

Screen freezes or flickers.

Artifacts or strange colors on screen.

System crashes when starting games.

Example:

A designer opens Photoshop and the screen shows distorted colors ‚Äì likely a faulty GPU.

7. Cooling System (Fans, Heat Sinks, Liquid Cooling)
What it does: Keeps the system components cool.

Failure Symptoms:

Overheating and shutdowns.

Loud fan noise.

Example:

The laptop gets extremely hot and shuts down. The internal cooling fan may have failed.

8. Network Card (Ethernet/Wi-Fi Adapter)
What it does: Connects the computer to a network/internet.

Failure Symptoms:

No internet connection.

"No network adapter found" error.

Example:

A user can't connect to Wi-Fi, while others in the office can ‚Äì the internal Wi-Fi card may have failed.

9. CMOS Battery
What it does: Powers BIOS memory to keep date/time and BIOS settings.

Failure Symptoms:

Wrong date/time on boot.

BIOS resets every restart.

Example:

A computer shows ‚ÄúPress F1 to enter setup‚Äù every time it boots ‚Äì likely a dead CMOS battery.

CMOS Battery	BIOS settings	Time resets	Date/time wrong on boot












‚úÖ 1. What is a Computer, OS, Hardware vs Software
üîπ What is a Computer?
A computer is an electronic machine that takes input (like a keyboard or mouse), processes it, stores data, and gives output (like displaying something on screen).

Analogy: Like a calculator ‚Äî you give numbers, it processes them, and shows the result.

üîπ What is an Operating System (OS)?
An Operating System is software that helps you interact with the computer and manages the hardware.

Popular OS: Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), macOS, Android.

Example: When you click an icon or open a file ‚Äî that‚Äôs the OS managing the process.

üîπ Hardware vs Software
Hardware (Physical)	Software (Programs)
Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor	Chrome, Word, VS Code
CPU, RAM, Hard Disk	Operating System, Games

Analogy: Hardware is like your body, and software is like your thoughts or skills.

‚úÖ 2. Files and Folders, File Extensions
üîπ What is a File?
A file is a collection of data, like a document, image, or video.

Examples:

resume.docx ‚Äì Word document

photo.jpg ‚Äì Image file

script.sh ‚Äì Shell script (used in Linux)

üîπ What is a Folder?
A folder stores files and other folders to organize data.

Analogy: Like a filing cabinet with folders and papers inside.

üîπ Common File Extensions
Extension	Meaning	Used For
.txt	Text File	Notes, logs
.exe	Executable	Windows program (e.g. setup.exe)
.sh	Shell Script	Linux script
.jpg	Image	Pictures
.pdf	PDF Document	E-books, resumes

‚úÖ 3. How the Internet Works (IP, DNS, HTTP Basics)
üîπ What is the Internet?
The internet is a network of computers connected around the world, sharing information.

Analogy: Like a postal system, but for digital information.

üîπ IP Address
Each device on the internet has a unique IP address, like a home address.

Example: 192.168.0.1 ‚Äì Like saying "send data to this house".

üîπ DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.

Example: When you type www.google.com, DNS finds its IP like 142.250.182.36.

Analogy: DNS is like a phonebook ‚Äî you look up a name (Google) to get the number (IP).

üîπ HTTP/HTTPS
HTTP: Protocol used to transfer web pages (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

HTTPS: Secure version of HTTP (encrypted)

Example:

http://example.com ‚Äì Unsecured

https://bank.com ‚Äì Secured (used in banking, shopping)

‚úÖ 4. Introduction to Command Line (Windows CMD, Linux Shell)
üîπ What is a Command Line?
A command line (or terminal) is a text-based interface where you type commands to control your computer.

Windows: CMD or PowerShell

Linux: Terminal or Shell (like Bash)

üîπ Common Linux Commands
Command	Description	Example
pwd	Show current directory	/home/user
ls	List files/folders	ls ‚Üí shows file1.txt
cd foldername	Change directory	cd Documents
mkdir test	Make a new folder	Creates a folder named test
touch file.txt	Create a new empty file	touch notes.txt
rm file.txt	Remove a file	rm notes.txt

Analogy: Like giving direct spoken instructions to your computer instead of using a mouse.
