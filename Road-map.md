Training someone with **zero IT or computer knowledge** to become an **AWS DevOps/SRE** professional is ambitious but absolutely doable with the right structured approach. You‚Äôll need to start with **foundational computer and IT concepts**, and gradually build up to **cloud, DevOps, and SRE tools and practices**.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Learning Path (Zero to SRE)

#### üß© Phase 1: **Computer Fundamentals (2‚Äì3 weeks)**

> Goal: Make them comfortable with basic computer operations and terminology.

Teach:

* What is a computer, OS (Windows, Linux), hardware vs software
* Files and folders, file extensions (.txt, .exe, .sh, etc.)

* Introduction to command line (Windows CMD, Linux Shell)

‚úÖ Hands-on:

* Basic Linux commands on Ubuntu (ls, cd, mkdir, touch, rm, etc.)
* Navigation using CLI and file manipulation

---

#### üß© Phase 2: **Networking & Linux Basics (3‚Äì4 weeks)**

> Goal: Build a strong base in Linux and Networking (must-have for SREs)

Teach:

* Linux basics (directory structure, permissions, users, processes)
* Basic bash scripting
* Networking fundamentals:

  * IP address, subnet, ports
  * HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, FTP
  * ping, curl, telnet, netstat

‚úÖ Hands-on:

* Setup Ubuntu VM (VirtualBox or WSL)
* Create users, give permissions
* SSH into servers, edit files using `vim/nano`
* Write basic bash scripts

---

#### üß© Phase 3: **Cloud Basics ‚Äì AWS (4‚Äì6 weeks)**

> Goal: Introduce AWS core services and concepts

Teach:

* What is cloud computing? Why AWS?
* Core AWS services:

  * EC2, S3, VPC, IAM, CloudWatch, RDS, ELB, ASG
* AWS console usage and CLI

‚úÖ Hands-on:

* Create EC2 instance, connect via SSH
* Host a static website in S3
* Set up a VPC and subnet
* Create IAM users and policies

---

#### üß© Phase 4: **DevOps Tools & Concepts (5‚Äì6 weeks)**

> Goal: Understand DevOps lifecycle, CI/CD, and basic automation

Teach:

* What is DevOps?
* CI/CD concepts
* Tools:

  * Git & GitHub
  * Jenkins
  * Docker
  * Terraform
  * Ansible (basic)
* Code versioning, branching strategies
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

‚úÖ Hands-on:

* Clone, push, and merge using Git
* Create Jenkins pipelines
* Write a Dockerfile and run a container
* Deploy infrastructure using Terraform
* Write a basic Ansible playbook

---

#### üß© Phase 5: **SRE Concepts & Advanced Topics (6+ weeks)**

> Goal: Teach monitoring, reliability, incident response, automation

Teach:

* What is SRE? Core principles
* SLIs, SLOs, SLAs
* Monitoring and alerting:

  * Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch
* Logging: ELK Stack or CloudWatch Logs
* On-call, runbooks, postmortems
* Reliability engineering: auto-healing, scaling, chaos engineering

‚úÖ Hands-on:

* Setup Prometheus + Grafana to monitor EC2
* Create alerts
* Write automation scripts to remediate incidents
* Simulate incident and run on-call scenario
